**__status on testing edited h5 code__**  
- 7/10/24 : getting stuck at line 210 in destripe_msl12.c, but no outside terminal compiling errors
- 7/11/24 : remove all nLw/Fo code from get_chl.c and get_k490.c to adjust to Rrs, removed more VIIRS code, added getchl, getk490, and l2_flags to github folder
- 7/16/24 : no chlor, k490 needed - so this code is removed
- 7/19/24 : removed uncessary parts of code (things not needed for Rrs), but same issue as 7/10, email sent to profs with update, code, output, and info
